## Aerillion Pact
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/zuoranartemwing/MindustryExpansion/blob/main/icon.png" height="100" width="100"></p>

Pact developed by Neon XZR. This pact delivers unique and *absurd* content to filling the battle with more chaos and fun, like a Rotary Ship Serie Unit (Basically an UFO) and literal CIWS. Analyzed by the 3 Factions, Aerillion Pact focuses on more DPS damage (low damage, quick firerate) rather than slow burst damage, althought, not all.

## Deltanex

Faction founded and developed by Kanaede, this faction is abandoned for unknown reasons. Further information needed
